Active learning on LiDAR data and Hyperspectral data
Active learning is a machine learning approach that involves selecting the most informative data points from a large unlabeled dataset, querying an expert to label them, and then incorporating these labeled examples into a model to improve its accuracy. In other words, active learning is a process of iteratively selecting and labeling the most valuable data points to improve a model's performance with minimal labeling effort.

Hyperspectral data and lidar data are two different types of remote sensing data that can be used in active learning.

Hyperspectral data is a type of remote sensing data that captures information about the reflectance properties of different materials in a scene over a range of narrow spectral bands. Each pixel in a hyperspectral image contains a spectrum that can be used to identify and classify the materials present in the scene. Active learning can be used to select the most informative pixels for labeling and improve the accuracy of a hyperspectral classification model.

Lidar data, on the other hand, is a type of remote sensing data that uses laser pulses to measure the distance between the sensor and the ground surface, generating a point cloud that can be used to create 3D models of terrain and objects. Lidar data can be used for a variety of applications, including terrain modeling, forest inventory, and urban mapping. Active learning can be used to select the most informative lidar points for labeling and improve the accuracy of a model for these applications.

In Python, active learning can be implemented using various libraries and frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. The specific implementation of active learning on hyperspectral and lidar data may involve preprocessing the data, selecting the most informative samples using an uncertainty or diversity-based sampling strategy, querying an expert to label the selected samples, and incorporating the labeled samples into a model using a suitable algorithm such as SVM, Random Forest, or Neural Networks. The performance of the model can be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and AUC.
